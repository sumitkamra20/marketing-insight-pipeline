## **🎯 Step-by-Step Breakdown**

### **Step 1: Understanding Your Question**
**What happens:** The AI agent reads your question and understands what you're asking for.

**Example:**
- **You ask:** "What were total sales last month?"
- **AI understands:** You want sales data for the previous month, grouped by total revenue

### **Step 2: Planning the Response**
**What happens:** The agent decides which data sources to check and how to get the information.

**Example:**
- **AI plans:** Query the sales table, filter by last month, calculate total revenue
- **Tool selection:** Chooses the sales query tool for this type of question

### **Step 3: Getting the Data**
**What happens:** The agent connects to your database and retrieves the relevant information.

**Example:**
- **Database query:** Searches through 52,000+ transactions
- **Data processing:** Filters, calculates, and organizes the results
- **Real-time access:** Gets live data from your Snowflake database

### **Step 4: Delivering Insights**
**What happens:** The agent analyzes the data and presents it in a business-friendly way.

**Example:**
- **Insight generation:** "Total sales last month were $2.3M, up 15% from previous month"
- **Visualization:** Creates charts and graphs automatically
- **Business context:** Explains what the numbers mean for your business

## **🏗️ LangGraph Nodes Architecture**

### **Technical Foundation Behind the Simple Flow**

While the user experience is simple, the technical architecture uses **LangGraph** to orchestrate multiple intelligent nodes:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "LangGraph Workflow"
        subgraph "Entry Point"
            START[User Query]
        end

        subgraph "Agent Node"
            AGENT[Agent Node<br/>LLM with Tools]
            SYSTEM_PROMPT[System Prompt<br/>Business Context]
        end

        subgraph "Decision Logic"
            CONDITION[Should Continue?<br/>Tool Calls Present?]
        end

        subgraph "Tool Node"
            TOOL_EXEC[Tool Execution<br/>Data Query Tools]
            TOOL_RESULT[Tool Results<br/>Formatted Response]
        end

        subgraph "Memory Management"
            MEMORY[Session Memory<br/>SQLite/Firestore]
            CONTEXT[Conversation Context<br/>User Preferences]
        end

        subgraph "Exit Point"
            END[Final Response]
        end
    end

    START --> AGENT
    AGENT --> SYSTEM_PROMPT
    AGENT --> CONDITION
    CONDITION --> TOOL_EXEC
    CONDITION --> END
    TOOL_EXEC --> TOOL_RESULT
    TOOL_RESULT --> AGENT
    AGENT --> MEMORY
    MEMORY --> CONTEXT
    CONTEXT --> AGENT
    AGENT --> END
